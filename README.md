# MEDICAL-IMAGING-IN-BRAIN-TUMOR-SEGMENTATION
This project focuses on the development of a deep learning-based model for the segmentation of brain tumours in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The goal is to create a system that can accurately and efficiently identify the tumour regions in the MRI images, which can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumours.
